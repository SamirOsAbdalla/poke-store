# PokeStore

A fun faux e-commerce site that allows shoppers to buy pokemon of their
choosing! 

# Pokemon Item
Each pokemon is displayed initially inside a small card. The pokemon can then be added to a cart
or be added to favorites.

# Pokemon Display
Once the user clicks on a specific pokemon, more information about the pokemon is displayed.
Things such as typing, stats, etc. are revealed to better inform the shopper about the pokemon
they would like to buy.

# Account
In order to actually favorite a pokemon, shoppers must create an account. Once an account is created, shoppers can change their name, password or even set a profile picture if they so please.
